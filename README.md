Code Written for JFSD JavaScript Assessment - Desmond Chua Yew Guan

● What did you like about this project? We did not have to do the coding from scratch this time round. There were some kickstarter codes given to kickstart the entire project. Without the kickstarter codes, it will be very difficult to think of the methods to be included in the class field to get the game running. Other than the constructor, methods such as generateField, runGame, print, askQuestion, isInBounds are also included in the class fields. This project is basically quite fun as it enables us to write a simple game using Js. Before I started coding, I broke down the tasks into 5 main tasks which were then further segregated into sub-tasks. While coding, I also added in my own comments to my own understanding to re-inforce JavaScript learning for the past two weeks. 

● What did you struggle with in this project? The 2D array concept was difficult to understand and apply at the start. Need thorough understanding of the concept before I can start coding and breaking the project into tasks. 

● What would make your experience with this assessment better? Overall, this assessment is very challenging for me. It might have been quite difficult to get the codes running without the starter codes, but I’m glad I managed to get it to work. Understanding of the class concept is very important. However, the inheritance concept and subclasses were not tested in this assessment. It also makes me think that I need to find more exercises to practise on my own in order to be able to code in JavaScript smoothly. Need to refer to my own notes and google quite a bit to get the whole game running.
